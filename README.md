# Etch a Sketch
This project by The Odin Project curruculum foundations of web development aims to incrase my skills in DOM manipulation. Really, It helped me a lot.

An Etch A Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line. The knobs create lineographic images. The left control moves the stylus horizontally, and the right one moves it vertically.

## What should I do?
For this project, I will implement a Etch a Sketch in Javascript. Notice that We have not to create the true Etch a Sketch but a simple large square that content a multiple smallest identic squares depending on dimension and user can hovering them to draw something. hovering a square change its color randomizily.
## My work
In this section, I put a couple of screenshoots takes when I a execute the drawer.

* The first to see when we execute the Etch a Sketch(default dimension is 16x16)

* A space with 50x50 grid of square.

![second](https://github.com/mbackeCISSE/odin_Etch-a-Sketch/blob/main/images/second.png?raw=true)

* When we are trying to draw.

![third](https://github.com/mbackeCISSE/odin_Etch-a-Sketch/blob/main/images/third.png?raw=true)
